Purpose/Description: Problem #3: (25 points)
(a) Implement a program in Java to sort a stack of integer in ascending order using for
this purpose another auxiliary (temp) stack.
You should not make any assumptions about how the stack is implemented. The
following are the only functions that should be used to write this program: push, pop,
peek, and isEmpty.
peek - operation that returns the value of the top element of the stack without
removing it.

(b) What is the running time complexity of your program? Justify.
-->ANSWER: I analyzed both best and worst case scenarios for this algorithm. The running
time complexity I got for best case is linear or O(n). However, for the worst case I got
the following formula for number of iteratioms of any input n: ((n^2)/2 + n/2). Taking the Big O
from this formula and the linear complexity for the best case I get: O((n^2)/2 + n/2 + n) ->
= O(max((n^2)/2 + n/2 + n))) = O((n^2)/2) = O(n^2). Therefore, I conclude that the running
time complexity for this solution is at most quadratic (> than linear but < than quadratic).
