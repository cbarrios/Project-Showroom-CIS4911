Purpose/Description: Problem #4: (25 points)
Given an array A of n integers, a leader element of the array A is the element that appears
more than half of the time in A.
Implement in Java an O(n) worst-case algorithm that uses a stack
static int leader(int[] A)
to find a leader element and return the index (any) of the leader in A. The program must
returns -1 if no leader element exists.
Examples:
int[] a = {23, 23, 67, 23, 67, 23, 45}; ====> leader(a) = 5
int[] a = {23, 24, 67, 23, 67, 23, 45}; ====> leader(a) = -1
